## design decisions or assumptions
These are deliberate choices made during the development process to achieve specific goals, meet requirements, or resolve trade-offs.
- Technology Stack:
  Choosing Ruby on Rails for backend development because of its productivity, convention-over- 
  configuration principle, and built-in tools.
Database Selection:
- Using PostgreSQL for its advanced features like JSONB support and scalability.
Frontend Framework:
- Selecting React.js for dynamic user interfaces or sticking with server-rendered views for 
  simplicity.
- Authentication and Authorization:
  Implementing Devise gem for authentication.
  Using Pundit or CanCanCan for role-based authorization.
